In this project, we aimed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. We started with a dataset where fraudulent transactions were rare compared to normal ones. We explored and cleaned the data, then used a Random Forest Classifier because itâ€™s both straightforward and good at handling imbalanced data. After training the model, we tested it and checked its performance using metrics like accuracy and precision. The model performed well, correctly identifying most fraudulent transactions, though it missed some due to the imbalance in the data. We also used a confusion matrix to visualize how well the model did. Overall, while the model worked well, it highlighted the need for ongoing improvements and better handling of data imbalance.
